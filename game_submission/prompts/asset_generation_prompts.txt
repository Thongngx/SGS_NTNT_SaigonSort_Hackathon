1. You are helping to build a 2D educational web game about waste sorting.  
Generate modular React components for UI elements such as bins, trash items, and overlays.  
Each component should:
- Use functional React syntax.
- Be visually simple but engaging.
- Handle relevant interactions (e.g., drag and drop, hover, progress bar updates).
- Be compatible with Tailwind CSS or plain CSS styling.

2. Generate JavaScript data objects for a web-based recycling game.  
The data should include:
- Trash item definitions (name, type, emoji/icon, category).
- Educational tips and fun facts related to recycling or waste management.
- Simple structures (arrays or objects) that can be easily imported into components.

Focus on clarity, variety, and educational tone.  
Use English text, but keep examples relevant to Vietnamâ€™s environmental context.

3. Generate React screens that define the user journey of a 2D educational web game about recycling.  
The screens should include:
- Menu screen (title, start button, navigation to guide or play).
- Game screen (main gameplay interface).
- End-of-day or summary screen (results, feedback, replay/next stage option).

Each screen should:
- Have clear and consistent navigation.
- Use props/state to manage transitions and game progress.
- Keep layout simple and responsive.

Ensure the flow creates an engaging and educational experience.
