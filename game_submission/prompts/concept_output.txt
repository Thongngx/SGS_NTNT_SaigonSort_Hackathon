## 🧩 **2. Game Mechanics**

### 🎯 **Core Mechanics**

| Mechanic                  | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trash Spawning**        | Random trash (plastic cup, banana peel, battery, paper bag, etc.) appears near the stall every few seconds.  |
| **Sorting (Drag & Drop)** | Player drags trash into 1 of 4 bins: Recycle ♻️, Compost 🌿, Landfill 🚮, E-waste ⚡.                         |
| **Timer Pressure**        | Trash must be sorted before the truck comes (e.g., 15 seconds). If missed, it counts as incorrectly sorted.  |
| **Scoring**               | +10 points & +1 Trust for correct; -5 points & +5 Pollution for incorrect.                                   |
| **Pollution Bar**         | Increases with mistakes. At 50%, event “Drain Clogged.” At 100%, “Street Flooded” = Game Over.               |
| **Upgrades**              | Earned between levels — Better Bins (higher score), Signs (slower timer), Community Help (reduce pollution). |

---

## ⚡ **4. Educational Integration**

Every few trash items, display a quick “Did You Know?” popup:

* “Vietnam produces over 3.6 million tonnes of plastic waste per year.”
* “Sorting waste helps reduce urban flooding during rainy season.”

*(These popups can appear between rounds or after pollution events.)*

## 🧠 **5. AI Vibe-Coding Prompts (to generate assets and logic)**

| Purpose           | Example Prompt                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concept Art**   | “Generate a cartoon-style background of a Ho Chi Minh City street with a Bánh mì cart and trash bins in 2D flat art style.”                                                |
| **Trash Sprites** | “Create 2D icons for: plastic cup, banana peel, battery, paper bag, plastic bottle, and Styrofoam box in a fun cartoon style.”                                             |
| **Code Logic**    | “Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a drag-and-drop sorting game with four bins and trash items. Each item has a data-type and must match a bin’s ID to score correctly.” |
| **Event Effects** | “Add a pollution bar that increases by 5 for incorrect sorting. At 50% show ‘Drain Clogged!’ and at 100% trigger ‘Street Flooded!’ game over screen.”                      |

## 🧮 **7. Core JavaScript Logic (Outline)**

```javascript
// Example structure (simplified)
const bins = document.querySelectorAll('.bin');
const trashItems = document.querySelectorAll('.trash');
let score = 0, trust = 0, pollution = 0;

trashItems.forEach(item => {
  item.addEventListener('dragstart', dragStart);
});

bins.forEach(bin => {
  bin.addEventListener('dragover', dragOver);
  bin.addEventListener('drop', dropItem);
});

function dropItem(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const itemType = e.dataTransfer.getData('type');
  const binType = e.target.id;
  
  if (itemType === binType) {
    score += 10;
    trust += 1;
  } else {
    score -= 5;
    pollution += 5;
  }
  
  updateUI();
  checkPollutionEvents();
}

function checkPollutionEvents() {
  if (pollution >= 50 && pollution < 100) showEvent('Drain Clogged!');
  if (pollution >= 100) endGame('Street Flooded!');
}
```

## 🧑‍🎨 **8. Visual & Audio Direction**

* **Art style:** Flat, vibrant, cartoonish (like *Dumb Ways to Die*).
* **Color palette:** Earthy greens, bright blues, Saigon yellow tones.
* **Sound cues:**

  * Correct sort → pleasant *ding!*
  * Incorrect sort → splash / buzz sound
  * Flood event → rushing water / thunder sound

## 🏗️ **9. Development Milestones**

| Phase                               | Duration | Deliverables                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Prototype (Core Drag & Drop)** | 1 week   | Working waste sorting with score + pollution bar |
| **2. Event System + UI Polish**     | 1 week   | Pollution events, sound, better animations       |
| **3. Educational Layer + Upgrades** | 1 week   | “Why Sort?” info screen, daily summary, upgrades |
| **4. Visual Polish + Launch Build** | 1 week   | Final art, responsive layout, playtesting        |

Total ≈ **4 weeks** for a polished playable version.
*(Shorter if using a simple HTML/CSS prototype for demo.)*

## 💬 **10. Expansion Ideas (Future Updates)**

* Multiplayer “Street Clean Challenge” mode (compare scores with friends)
* School leaderboard or district ranking
* Integration with real environmental data APIs (optional)
* Mobile-friendly version (PWA) with offline play

Would you like me to create the **next step — the flowchart (visual of user journey and game logic flow)** for *Saigon Sort*?
I can design it in structured ASCII or UML-style format (or a diagram-ready version for Figma / draw.io).
