1. There are a few changes I want to be made

- I have added tailwindcss package, so convert all css and/or files into tailwind wherever necessary
- I prefer everything to be light theme
- Slightly lower the game speed since it's too fast right now
- When there is a pop up for pollution increase, make it at the top of the page and do not prompt 
for continue as it is obstructive.


2. Now, can you make a page as a documentation for how to play the game, a "dictionary" for all items and
where they go, what each stats mean. Additionally, I prefer to remove the Vietnamese text as well

3. Center the menu and gameplay elements as well to the center of the screen, right now it's top aligned.
Still keep the pop up for pollution at the top though.

4. 
- The button for trash type is too big now, make it smaller height-wise for me.
- Make game speed increment on each day if it hasn't already. It should still be higher than the amount
that the user can slow down through upgrades though.
- Add high score menu which persists even if user closes page.
- Add wider variety of trash.
